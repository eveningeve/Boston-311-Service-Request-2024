# Boston-311-Service-Request-2024
## Project Overview
This project analyzes Boston’s 311 service request data to identify community service gaps, optimize resource allocation, and improve municipal response efficiency. By incorporating spatial, temporal, and environmental factors, the study provides data-driven insights for better city service management.

## Objectives
1. Identify high-demand neighborhoods and service categories to address geographic service gaps
2. Analyze seasonal and time-based trends to optimize staffing and resource allocation
3. Examine the impact of weather conditions on service demand to enable proactive planning
4. Evaluate departmental response performance to uncover efficiency bottlenecks

## Methodology
Data Processing: Cleaned and structured 311 service request data using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Exploratory Analysis: Conducted spatial, temporal, and categorical analysis of service requests
Feature Engineering: Integrated weather data and time-based variables (seasonality, time-of-day, weekends)
Visualization: Built interactive plots and dashboards using Matplotlib and Seaborn
Performance Evaluation: Compared response times across departments and service types

## Key Findings
Neighborhood Demand: Dorchester, Roxbury, and South Boston show the highest 311 request volumes
Seasonality:
Summer → Higher demand for parking enforcement & waste management
Winter → Spikes in sidewalk and street maintenance requests
Department Variability: Some departments show consistently high on-time performance, while others struggle with complex cases
Weather Effects: Cold months increase sidewalk clearing needs, warm months amplify compliance-related requests

## Impact & Contributions
* Provided actionable insights for city managers to optimize resource allocation and reduce response times
* Supported evidence-based decision-making for improving service equity across neighborhoods
* Demonstrated how integrating external data (e.g., weather) can improve predictive understanding of urban service demands
